# Foundry models for molecular prediction

This project aims to build machine learning models to predict properties of organic molecules using SOTA (state of the art) methods devised by the top researchers in this field, and deploy them on a cloud environment using Cloud Foundry. We are aiming to build a tool that demonstrates the ease of building, deploying, and running models on the cloud without having to deal with issues regarding local dependencies, outdated libaries and others.


This repository contains several prediction models built by myself (James Ma) and Sahas Gelli over the summer of 2021.
